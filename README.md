## Motivation

## Project Details
__Goal:__ Understand and benchmark different multimodal datasets in a federated setting

__Deliverables:__  
• Understand multimodal federated learning  
• Use given datasets to reproduce the results in the paper  
• Perform a per-class accuracy analysis of the results and observe the effect of skewed data distribution on the per-class accuracy  
• Evaluate the system on a multimodal dataset that is relatively balanced in class distribution
