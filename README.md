__Project:__ Federated Learning on Multimodal Sensor Data  
__DATE:__ 28/09/2024  

## Motivation
Our group has chosen Federated Learning on Multimodal Sensor Data as our Porject In recent years, we’ve seen that data security and privacy in machine learning are crucial issues. Based on our current research, Federated Learning has unique advantages in various fields. It allows devices to train data without sharing it, which is essential in privacy-sensitive fields like healthcare. Additionally, I believe this technology is flexible, as it can utilize data from multiple sources, meaning that distributed sensors and devices can be used as needed.  
Finally, our recent studies have highlighted the importance of time synchronization and communication. Federated Learning allows data to be trained and updated directly on devices, reducing the need for constant communication with servers, which lowers communication delays and reduces the need for time synchronization. This can be applied to devices like autonomous vehicles and wearable health monitors. For these reasons, our group believes that Federated Learning is a technology we want to study and is definitely worth learning.

## Project Details  
__Goal:__ Understand and benchmark different multimodal datasets in a federated setting

__Deliverables:__  
• Understand multimodal federated learning  
• Use given datasets to reproduce the results in the paper  
• Perform a per-class accuracy analysis of the results and observe the effect of skewed data distribution on the per-class accuracy  
• Evaluate the system on a multimodal dataset that is relatively balanced in class distribution  

__System blocks (Temporary):__
Basic data, variable data, configuration files, training models, runtime logic, operation commands, and results.  

__HW/SW requirements:__
Python, Laptop with CUDA-enabled GPU, PC with CUDA-enabled GPU  

__Team members' responsibilities:__  
Based on the available data, the group members will collaborate to conduct research on Federated Learning. We plan to start by studying the concept and basic runtime logic of Federated Learning, and then further search for existing research papers to share and discuss the knowledge we've gained.  
After gaining a comprehensive understanding of Federated Learning, we will delve into studying the code, combining it with theory to explore the principles and runtime logic of deep learning code. The research on each functional block will be discussed and reasonably allocated.  
Finally, we will work together to complete the report based on the acquired knowledge. Throughout the process, the tasks for each member will be reasonably assigned according to their actual learning progress.
